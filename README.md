## 4. Scaling Agile
- Multiple frameworks/tools
- Simplest to most complex

### 4.1 Scrum of Scrums  
- AKA meta Scrum
- One representative from each team
  - Scrum master?
- Daily scrum with all these representatives
  - Sync everything in that meeting
  - completions
  - next steps 
  - impediments 
  - on behalf of the teams they represent
  
### 4.2 Nexus 
- Augment scrums
  - One new role
  - Expanded events and artifacts
- [Life cycle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/scrumorg-website-prod/drupal/2016-09/NexusPoster17x11.pdf)
- Nexus
  - Unit
  - 3 to 9 Scrum teams
- One extra team
  - Integration team
  - Responsible for all integrations
  - Members from Scrum teams can be part of Nexus team
  - Nexus work takes precedence as impacts more people
- Product backlog
  - Should be detailed enough before teams can start working on it
  - Dependencies must be identified and preferably resolved
  - Backlog distribution should be made to minimize dependencies
- Daily Scrum
  - Nexus daily occurs first
  - Identify dependencies and integration problems
  - Use it as input for Scrum daily so teams can plan their work accordingly
- Influences technical architecture
  - Architecture can simplify synchronization and scaling problems
### 4.2 LeSS  
### 4.4 SAFe

- MoSCoW
  - Must
  - Should
  - Could
  - Won't
- Prune Tree (meh)
- Speed Boat
  - Pain driven
- Financial analysis

## 7. Facilitating retrospective  
- Like a negotiation
  - Separate people from the problem
  - Interests and not positions
  - Objective criteria
- Opportunity to:
  - learn
  - build trust

## 8. Spotify agile model
- Pillars: 
  - Autonomy
  - Direction
  - Community
- Squads
  - Cross functional
  - TA - Testing automation
  - QA - Quality assistance
- Tribe
- 1 Tribe -> N Squads
- Chapter
  - Same role 
  - Cross squads
- Guilds
  - Same role
  - Cross tribes
- Squads/tribes structure reflect communication requirements
- Heavily based/dependent on software architect
  - Release train (leaves no matter what)
    - Feature flags
  - One click deploy
  - Continuous integration
  - Limited blast radius and partial rollout
- Culture
  - Mistakes are not punished
    - Otherwise people hide them
  - Failure recovery > failure avoidance
  - Blame is not handed off to other people
    - Squad who builds it, owns it
  - Optmize for value
  - Measure impact and not output
  - Data > opinion
- Health check
  - Systemic problems
- New ideas
  - Think it
    - PR Story
    - Metrics (what does success looks like?)
  - Build it
  - Ship it
  - Tweak it
